I have Provided 2 folders, searchengine and backend respectively.

The backend folder has corpus file already

First you need to install modules in both frameworks to operate which you do by `npm i` or `npm install`.
Then you need to start both the servers so for that i have configured them in such a way that you run `npm start` in both the folders and it will start.

The backend server runs on `5000` and frontend in `3000`, i have also enabled cors headers for that purpose.

I tried multiple algorithms but my approach that i used was fast, also do not open the hemingway.txt file since it will stop the updation part of corpus.

Thanks!
